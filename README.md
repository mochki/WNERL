Wikipedia's Never Ending Reading List

The idea behind this project is that a user wants to learn more about a topic or field but "they don't know what they don't know." I thought Wikipedia's breath of topics and links and data was enough to mine this sort of information. I have built something where you can put in a Wikipedia page and get back the top 5 most recommended topics that are related to the given page.

This was my final project for my machine learning/data mining class. There's a lot of interesting data here but I can't upload the 60 GBs of Wikipedia I download or the scrubbed version where it was all just page and links data. I also can't upload the 9 GB sql database with all of that and other interesting data. I will be releasing a website in the future that allows everyone to access all of this.

Sorry this READMME is kind of incoherent. My cousin was showing me old retro games as I typed this and we all know humans can't multitask.
